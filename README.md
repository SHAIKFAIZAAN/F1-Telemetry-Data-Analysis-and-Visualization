# F1-Telemetry-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
Developed a data analysis project using Python and the FastF1 library to visualize telemetry data from Formula 1 races. Analyzed key performance metrics such as speed, RPM, gear shifts, throttle, and braking across various circuits. Created detailed plots that illustrate the relationship between car performance metrics and track positions.
